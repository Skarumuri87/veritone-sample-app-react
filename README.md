# Veritone Sample App - React

The [Veritone][veri] sample app is a minimal boilerplate for creating [Veritone][veri] powered web applications ([SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)s).

### Tech Stack
* [Create React App][cra] for development and test infrastructure (see [user guide][cradocs])
* [React][react] + [Redux][redux] for UI and declarative data fetching.

### Walkthrough
* [Sample App Walkthrough][saw] â€“ How the sample app functions.

### Requirements
* node `^6.4.0`
* yarn `^0.24.5` or npm `^3.10.3`

You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

### Installation
We recommend using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for dependency management, but `npm install` will suffice.

```bash
$ yarn install # Install project dependencies (or `npm install`)
```

### Quick Start
* Clone this repo and install the dependencies
```sh
git clone https://github.com/veritone/veritone-sample-app-react.git
cd veritone-sample-app-react/
yarn install
```

* Create a local development alias in your `hosts` file for the new app.
  * edit `/etc/hosts` with `sudo` using your preferred text editor
  * add: `127.0.0.1   local.veritone.com`

* [Create a Veritone developer account](https://www.veritone.com/onboarding/#/signUp?type=developer) if you don't already have one.

* [Register a new Veritone application](https://developer.veritone.com/applications/overview/new/details).
  * URL: `http://local.veritone.com:3000`
  * Oauth2 Redirect URL: `http://local.veritone.com:3000/auth/veritone/callback`

* In the files `.env` and `.env.development`, fill in the CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET and CALLBACK_URL fields. These can be found by going to https://developer.veritone.com/applications and clicking your application in the table. The fields are shown underneath the application name at the top of the page.

* Start the development server
```sh
yarn start
```

### Building for Production
```bash
$ yarn build  # Build production assets (or `npm run build`)
```
